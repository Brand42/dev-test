# Project background

We have a hypothetical new client (LogoLogo) who needs a website up and running asap. To this end, we have designed an MVP site that includes some articles, a map, a sign up form and a footer with contact and social links. There is also an article page with a few details about the author.

LogoLogo have 2 offices, one in London an one in the Caribbean. They want to show both offices on one map somehow. They were wondering if you had any ideas of an interesting way to do this?

We are aware that this is a 2 hour test, and so you are not expected to complete all tasks. The number of elements have been provided to give you a chance to show off in an area that you enjoy. We will expect however for all layout to be complete, all code to be tidy and the project to be in a state in which you would be happy to hand to another developer.

We have provided all images needed for the design. We have mocked up a starting point for the exercise using expressJS.

You can use your own framework if you’d like, using as much or as little (or none at all) of the sample site as you want. What we want to see from you is an engagement with the task and designs, building a responsive site matching the designs and adding to the overall UX.

We have also included jpg mock ups of the pages. Our usual working practice is to handover designs in a system such as Zeplin to specify exact sizes, as you will not have this, please just use your judgement and try to match the designs as closely as possible.

Key deliverables:
  - Candidate should provide a link or zip to a version controlled repository (git, svn etc.) 
  - Project should be able to be run on a local environment easily. Any installation instructions should be included in the readme (if it required any specific environment which isn’t node or http server please include container or virtualization as well).
  - Project should be responsive.
  - Not all elements are required, please focus on your strengths and show us your creativity.
  - Please outline in the readme what elements you chose to focus on, what you found easy, what you found hard and provide any feedback on the test in general.

### Notes

Please do not share this test as it could provide unfair advantage to future candidates.

Include the amount of time spent in the readme, we appreciate that you have a life and we're not expecting you to have built it all, 2 hours is a good cutting off point.

Have fun with it, we are looking to see how you approach problem solving and creative thinking, we are not trying to catch anyone out.
